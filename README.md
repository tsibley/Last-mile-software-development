# Last mile software development: Writing modern software for bench scientists

This is the talk I gave at The Perl Conference 2017.

The talk is available from this repository in three ways:

1. [A very well-done video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdc9sj8P9Ys) (thanks TPC!)
2. My source material, a plain-text Markdown file: [slides.md](slides.md)
3. My slides as-presented using a dynamic HTML page: run `make` and then open [http://localhost:12345/index.html?showNotes=1](http://localhost:12345/index.html?showNotes=1)

The bulk of the talk is in my presenter notes (which are also in slides.md), so
you'll want to be sure to read those.  You can enable those in the interactive
slideshow by pressing <kbd>S</kbd>.

## Talk abstract in conference program

This talk will focus on the need for, process of, and impact of developing
custom software and data systems for scientists. My aim is to give you a
glimpse into the rewarding world of software in science by drawing from
concrete examples in own my experience of building systems using Perl, Python,
JavaScript, Elm, and many other languages. For over three years now I've been
the staff programmer in a biology research lab at the University of Washington,
and I'll share what I've learned along the way after making the jump from
commercial software development.

Interested in learning more about software in science? This talk is for you!

Do startups excite you? A science research lab has more in common with a
startup than you might think!

Enjoy learning new domain knowledge to get your job done? Biology is
fascinating and amazing!
